# Backup Object
Backup Object is a workflow addon for easily creating backups of object(s) with a click of a button. No need to worry about messing up the mesh or object settings of your object when you can go back to your previous backup. 

Object backups are neatly organized into their own separate collections to easily reference. Automatically hidden from the viewport and renderduplicating/iterating models and organizing them in collections to easily save backups of an object. 

Useful when modeling and sculpting objects where you would like to save a backup of a model before changing it. Rather than risking ruining a model, with one click you can easily have a backup.
