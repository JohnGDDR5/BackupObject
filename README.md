# Iterate Object
IterateObject is a workflow addon for easily duplicating/iterating models and organizing them in collections to easily save iterations of an object.

Useful when modeling and sculpting objects where you would like to save a backup of a model before changing it. Rather than running the risk of ruining a model afterwards, you can easily have a backup to go to with a click of a button. 

Use Cases:
  Wanting a quick backup of a specific or many objects when working on a project.
  When Retopologizing an object and a point comes where a drastic topology change is needed.
  When Sculpting an object and wanting to explore different versions.
  Destructive Modeling.
