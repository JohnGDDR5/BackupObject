# Backup Object
Backup Object is a workflow addon to easily save "backups" of states of an object and organizing them in their own collections.

Useful when modeling and sculpting objects where you would like to save a backup of a model before changing it. Rather than running the risk of ruining a model afterwards, you can easily have a backup to go to with a click of a button. 

Use Cases:
  Wanting to save a state of a an object/s when working on a project just incase the modeling goes bad.
  When Retopologizing an object and a point comes where a drastic topology change is needed.
  When Sculpting an object and wanting to explore different versions.
  Destructive Modeling.
